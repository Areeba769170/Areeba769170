# Hi there 👋, I'm Areeba

📚 **About me:**  
🎓 I’m a master’s student and aspiring researcher in cryptography, passionate about exploring applied crypto, secure multi-party computation (MPC), zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), and isogeny-based protocols.  
⚡ I’m a self-learner who loves diving into research papers, building cryptographic proofs, and experimenting with privacy-enhancing technologies (PETS).  
✌️ I’m optimistic and curious, always excited to tackle challenging problems in security and privacy.  
😎 My passion lies in academia and research, where I aim to push the boundaries of provable security and practical cryptography.  
💻 I enjoy bridging theory and practice: implementing secure protocols, designing cryptographic schemes, and writing formal proofs.  
👐 I refuse to limit myself to one field — I explore multiple domains in security, cryptography, and privacy.  
✈️ Outside of work, I love travel, food, and adventure — saving experiences over things!
